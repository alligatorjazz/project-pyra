## pyromancer idea
- the player is a pyromancer whose life, attacks, and light all come from a fire that is gradually being extinguished
- their objective is to light a series of lighthouse fires on various islands in an archipelago
- throughout the entire game the player is managing the dwindling amount of energy they have for the flame
- while trying to reach these lighthouses, they are beset by various enemy types:
	- type a: creatures that cannot see in the dark, but are attracted to light and will attack the player only when they can see them. 	
	- type b: creatures that can see in the dark, but are afraid of light.
	- type c: creatures that can see in light or dark, and will attack the player regardless of the lighting conditions.
-  the player has various tools to fight and avoid enemies:
	- 1. stealth. enemies will only aggro the player once they are in their line-of-sight or close enough, depending on the enemy's behavior toward light
	- 2. illumination. the player needs light to navigate the levels and some enemies are afraid of it
	- 3. fireballs. the player can expend more of their flame to shoot attack enemies with fireballs.
