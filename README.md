# Project Pyra

## Overview
Project Pyra is a stealth action game about a lonely pyromancer who must traverse a perilous archipelago to reignite a collection of dormant lighthouses. The game's core loop centers around the way that enemies, the environment, and the player character react to fire and light.

## Gameplay

### The Player
The player inhabits a pyromancer equipped with various spells that produce or manipulate fire. At first, the spells the player have access to are extremely minimal, but they gain strength and potency with each lighthouse the player successfully reignites.
1. **Illumination**: The pyromancer can illuminate an area immediately surrounding them. While this allows the player to see their surroundings, it also reveals their position to nearby enemies. As the ability grows more powerful, the illuminated area gradually increases. At its maximum power, the illumination can be charged to execute a flashbang attack that stuns most enemies.
2. **Fireball**: The pyromancer can shoot a fireball at enemies and puzzle objects. At first, the fireball is puny and only useful for lighting torches and grass, but it gradually grows in power until it can eventually be used against powerful foes. The fireball also possesses illumination properties.
3. **Super Jump**: The pyromancer can use concentrated detonations to propel them across small gaps and up to unreachable places. In each case, a trail of fire is left behind. At first, this can be a liability due to it alerting nearby enemies, but at its maximum power this fire trail becomes a potent source of damage.
